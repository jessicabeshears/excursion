Codecademy Project
------------------

This began as a codecademy project, however I changed a fair amount when playing
around with the css. 

Personal changes include: 
1. image clipping with header text
2. adding a 'page divider' with a border bottom under header
3. color and opacity changes
4. moving elements around to make more sense (...that was in the HTML, but whatever)
5. adding a cropped map image 
6. slight transition for the app download 'link'
