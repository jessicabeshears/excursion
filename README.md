Exursion App Page
=================
       
Codecademy Project
------------------
       
      
For this project, I am working with Git/GitHub in order to build an app preview page from design mockup. Since it is not a real app, the links will just take you to the app store.
      
*Below are images of the mockup and redline*

![redline](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/mocks/excursion_redline.png)  
     
Steps given:  
1. Review mockup and redline
2. Open command line, make a new directory
3. Create html and css files
4. Initialize repository
5. Add files to staging area, commit
6. Create remote repository, connect
7. Setup HTML, commit
8. Replicate mockup, commiting throughout
9. Final commit and push
