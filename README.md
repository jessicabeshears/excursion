#Exursion App Page
###Codecademy Project
      
For this project, I am working with Git/GitHub in order to build an app preview page from design mockup. Since it is not a real app, the links will just take you to the app store.
      
*Below are images of the mockup and redline*

Steps given:  
1. Review mockup and redline
